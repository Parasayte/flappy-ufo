## Overview

**Flappy UFO** is a 2D arcade game where players control a UFO and navigate it through obstacles. The game features smooth mechanics, customizable difficulty options, and pixel art created in Aseprite for a retro gaming experience.

## Features

- **Customizable Difficulty**: Adjust game elements like gravity, jump height, and game speed.
- **Pixel Art Design**: Retro-style assets created in Aseprite.
- **High Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the highest score achieved in a session.
- **Smooth Controls**: Intuitive, responsive controls for a seamless gameplay experience.
## Increasing Difficulty

As players score higher in *Flappy UFO*, the game gradually speeds up, increasing the pace at which obstacles approach. This simple but effective change keeps the gameplay challenging, requiring faster reflexes and sharper timing as the score climbs.

## Realistic Gravity

In *Flappy UFO*, **realistic gravity** adds a challenging twist to the gameplay. By simulating a gravitational pull, the UFO gradually accelerates downward, requiring precise timing to keep it afloat. This mechanic gives players a more immersive experience, as they must master the balance between ascent and descent. 

The **Options** menu lets players adjust gravity settings to their preference:
- **Lower gravity**: Slows the UFO's descent, making the game easier for beginners.
- **Higher gravity**: Increases the UFO's falling speed, adding difficulty for experienced players seeking a challenge.

Fine-tuning gravity settings allows for a highly customizable experience, letting players find the right balance for a smoother or more intense gameplay feel.
